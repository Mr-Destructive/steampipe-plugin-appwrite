## Quick start

Install the plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```shell
steampipe plugin install mr-destructive/appwrite
```

Configure your plugin in `~/.steampipe/config/appwrite.spc`:

```hcl
connection "appwrite" {
  plugin = "mr-destructive/appwrite"

  # Secret key for requests. Required.
  # This can also be set via the `APPWRITE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
  # secret_key = "7a1f0d410a6ab90110232e3f9578a0e5ac33453493930e195c7"

  # Project Id for specific appwrite project. Required
  # This can also be set via the `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.
  # project_id = "68a121f3e41164679a30"
}
```
Or through environment variables:

```
export APPWRITE_SECRET_KEY="7a1f0d410a6ab90110232e3f9578a0e5ac33453493930e195c7"
export APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="68a121f3e41164679a30"
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

Run a query:

```sql
select
  *
from
  account
where
  name = ''
```
