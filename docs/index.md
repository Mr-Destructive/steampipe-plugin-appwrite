| Credentials |                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Permissions | API Keys have the same permissions as the user who creates them, and if the user permissions change, the API key permissions also change.                                                                                                                                               |
| Radius      | Each connection represents a single appwrite Installation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Resolution  | 1. Credentials explicitly set in a steampipe config file (`~/.steampipe/config/appwrite.spc`)<br />2. Credentials specified in environment variables. |

### Configuration

Installing the latest comereai plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/appwrite.spc`) with a single connection named `appwrite`:

```hcl
connection "appwrite" {
  plugin = "mr-destructive/appwrite"

  # Secret key for requests. Required.
  # This can also be set via the `APPWRITE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
  # secret_key = "7a1f0d410a6ab90110232e3f9578a0e5ac33453493930e195c7"

  # Project Id for specific appwrite project. Required
  # This can also be set via the `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.
  # project_id = "68a121f3e41164679a30"
}
```

## Credentials from Environment Variables

The Appwrite plugin will use the standard Appwrite environment variables to obtain credentials only if other arguments (secret_key and project_id) are not specified in the connection:

```
export APPWRITE_SECRET_KEY="7a1f0d410a6ab90110232e3f9578a0e5ac33453493930e195c7"
export APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="68a121f3e41164679a30"
```
