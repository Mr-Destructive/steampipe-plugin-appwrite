| Credentials |                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Permissions | API Keys have the same permissions as the user who creates them, and if the user permissions change, the API key permissions also change.                                                                                                                                               |
| Radius      | Each connection represents a single appwrite Installation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Resolution  | 1. Credentials explicitly set in a steampipe config file (`~/.steampipe/config/appwrite.spc`)<br />2. Credentials specified in environment variables. |

### Configuration

Installing the latest comereai plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/appwrite.spc`) with a single connection named `appwrite`:

```hcl
connection "appwrite" {
  plugin = "mr-destructive/appwrite"

}
```
